# Vegi Sushi Restaurant Website

## About

This is a webpage for a restaurant that I made for [The Odin Project Javascript Module, Project: Restaurat Page](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/javascript/lessons/restaurant-page). The purpose of this was to practice DOM manipulation by dynamically rendering a restaurant website, using Webpack.

It contains all the information you'd expect to find for a local restaurant, and also has basic mobile responsiveness.

## Roadmap

To do updates in known issues below.

### Known Issues

* Time picker does not have a min-max - to fix. Perhaps make dropdown list with selected times (e.g. each quarter of hour);
* Pics are slow to load - fix;
* Add map on 'contact' page;
* Add drinks menu and ability to toggle between the two;
* Mobile responsiveness is basic and not tested on multiple devices;
* Transitions (e.g. hamburger menu) are not as smooth as I'd like.
